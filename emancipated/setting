If you aren't familiar with the Eve universe, here's what you need to know:

- There are four major factions in the Eve universe: the Amarr Empire, the
  Minmatar Republic, the Gallente Federation, and the Caldari State.
- All of the factions are human, but there are slight morphological differences
  between them.
- The Amarr Empire is a theocracy.
- The Amarr religion teaches that non-Amarr peoples are inferior and must be led
  to righteousness by the Amarr, and that non-Amarr peoples can only earn their
  salvation by serving true Amarr; hence, slavery (both as slaveowner and slave)
  is a sacred duty in Amarr.
- Until a hundred or so years ago, all of what is now the Minmatar Republic was
  owned by the Amarr, who enslaved the Minmatar people in vast numbers. Many
  Minmatar are still enslaved in Amarr territory.
- One of the ways the Amarr keep slaves under control is by infecting them with
  a virus called 'Vitoxin', for which there is no permanent cure*. The slaves
  are then given a drug called 'Vitoc' which wards off the effects temporarily,
  but has psychological effects similar to those of MDMA: feelings of deep trust
  and intimacy for others, euphoria, lack of fear/aggression response, and
  occasional hallucinations or synesthesia. Without regular doses of Vitoc (once
  every day or so), the Vitoxin leads to a gruesome death.

*: Some canon documents mention a permanent cure called 'Insorum', but it is
implied that Insorum is used only when necessary to free entire planets or to
spark slave uprisings; in my story, Insorum is not widely known outside the
senior leadership of the Minmatar Republic and would not be available to
ordinary people or even most capsuleers.
