# Writing

This repo contains some of my prose (i.e., not code) writing. All of this is
embarassingly amateurish; I enjoy writing, but I find it difficult and I am not
very good at it. Grammar/spelling pull requests gladly accepted; please open
bugs for semantic problems :). Beware that if you look at files called 'notes'
in story directories, you will be reading my half-baked list of story/plot idas,
which may either spoil the story for you, or make you long for a story that
could have been. Have a look at the file called 'summary' in each story
directory for a brief description of it.
